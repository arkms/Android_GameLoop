# Android_GameLoop
Mini engine in Java for Android in Android Studio to make games.

I developed this engine in the University, so it is not completely polished and can be optimized, but it is a good starting point if you want to make a game for Android without a framework, good for learning the basics of video games.
Any doubt or question do not hesitate to ask.

Its use is completely free, as distribution and modification.
